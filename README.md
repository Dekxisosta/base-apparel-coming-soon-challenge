# Frontend Mentor - Base Apparel coming soon page solution

This is a solution to the [Base Apparel coming soon page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/base-apparel-coming-soon-page-5d46b47f8db8a7063f9331a0). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Built with
Markup / Structure: HTML5, Semantic HTML, BEM
Styling / Layout: CSS3, CSS Variables, Flexbox, Grid, Animations/Transitions, Media Queries
Scripting / Interactivity: JavaScript, DOM Manipulation
Tools / Build / Workflow: NPM, Git/GitHub, Vite

### What I learned
Never really understood position: relative and position: absolute. I was dumb to think they override display: flex/grid, but
now I know you can use them simultaneously. I'm excited to use this more in the future

I did not implement SCSS, SASS, Stylus, or LESS because I want to develop a deeper understanding with the current CSS properties.
Although, I used the SCSS file naming convention to illustrate which among the scripts are exposed to main.js
